The dataset includes 845 images.
Cars-bikes are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -23 and +23 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.88 percent of pixels
